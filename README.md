## About the project
is an extension of the [wumpus game](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wumpus-Welt) by a multi-agent environment approach with
- communication between agents
- different classes of agents with different focuses
- A*-algorithm (heuristic: utility function coupled with the Manhatten distance) as the traversal algorithm through the map

### Build with

### Rough structural diagram
<img src="media/wumpusStructure.png" width="500" height="350"/>

## Agents
<ul>
  <li>in general the agents are risk-avoidant in the context of exploring the map, meaning they won't walk on ◊Wumpus or ◊Pit tiles (for context see section <a href="#map">Map</a>)</li>
  <li>agents were implemented as being selfish as they follow their own goal</li>
</ul>

### Agent classes
<ol>
  <li>Hunter</li>
  <ul>
    <li>can kill wumpi with an arrow whose range is his von neumann neighbourhood</li>
    <li>arrow replenishes every 32 rounds</li>
    <li>prioritizes killing wumpi</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Cartograph</li>
  <ul>
    <li>has a map of all the tiles with condition "WALL" (ref)</li>
    <li>prioritizes map progress</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Knight</li>
  <ul>
    <li>can kill wumpi by standing on its inhabited tile every 32 rounds</li>
    <li>if the knight steps on a wumpi without waiting for the replenish, it dies</li>
    <li>prioritizes gold and killing wumpi</li>
  </ul>
  <li>BWL-Student</li>
  <ul>
    <li>can sniff out gold tiles through a radius of 5 tiles</li>
    <li>prioritizes gold</li>
  </ul>
</ol>

## Map
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="media/wumpusMap.png" width="500" height="500"/>
    <td>⬛ <strong>Black:</strong> Wall<br>🟥 <strong>Red:</strong> Wumpus<br>🟩 <strong>Green:</strong> Stench<br>🟦 <strong>Blue:</strong> Pit<br>🟦 <strong>Light Blue:</strong> Breeze<br>🟨 <strong>Yellow:</strong> Shiny<br>🟠 <strong>Orange:</strong> Agent
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Brief explanation of the world
<ul>
  <li>a wumpus is always surrounded by stenches</li>
  <li>a pit is always surrounded by breezes</li>
  <li>stepping on a wumpus tile or a pit tile leads to the agent dying</li>
  <li>walls cannot be stepped upon
  <li>collecting gold by stepping on it stores it inside the agents inventory</li>
</ul>

## Knowledge Base
### Possible states of a field

<table>
  <tr>
    <th rowspan="2">Allowed additional states</th>
    <th colspan="7">Field states that are mutually exclusive</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Safe</th>
    <th>Wumpus</th>
    <th>Pit</th>
    <th>Wall</th>
    <th>Unknown (1)</th>
    <th>Unknown (2)</th>
    <th>Unknown (3)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Stench</strong></td>
    <td>🟩</td><td>🟥</td><td>🟥</td><td>🟥</td><td>🟩</td><td>🟥</td><td>🟥</td>

  </tr>
</table>
<i>Note: the logical ◊ operator stands for a possibility</i>

<ul>
  <li>the knowledge base of an agent uses predicate logic and modal logic approaches to deduce new from old knowledge through predictions and re-predictions</li>
  <li>Unknown (1|2|3) means that the state of the tile condition is to be deduced through further knowledge</li>
  <li>predictions are marked accordingly in the map through pink for "◊Wumpus" and teal for "◊Pit"</li>
</ul>

### Example prediction
<img src="media/examplePrediction.png" width="750" height="250"/>

## Communication
<ul>
  <li>communication (1:n) happens if it helps the agent to achieve his goal quicker</li>
  <li>the trading objects that can be exchanged in a communication are</li>
  <ul>
    <li>gold</li>
    <li>tile information</li>
    <li>wumpus kill tasks</li>
  </ul>
  <li>agents can only communicate with agents on the same tile</li>
  <li>if an agent wants to initiate a communication, it creates a channel</li>
  <li>the implementation of the communication follows the contract net protocol</li>
  <li>here a brief sequence of steps after the initialization of the channel</li>
  <ol>
    <li>initiator requests a trading object</li>
    <li>participants decide if to join the communication</li>
    <li>if joined, they will give their offers</li>
    <li>initiator evaluates offer</li>
    <li>if satisfying offers found, choose the best</li>
    <li>if no satisfying offers found $\forall$ participants, go into negotiation (max 3 rounds)</li>
  </ol>
  <li>to briefly summarize the negotiation: the initiator asks for new offers and the process repeats itself; if an agent does not have a better offer, it leaves the communication entirely</li>
  <li>if no satisfying deal is found after the 3 negotiation rounds, the communication is discontinued without a result</li>
</ul>
